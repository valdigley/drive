  # Fix Suppliers RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing policies that check auth.users table
    - Create new simplified policies for admin access
    - Allow authenticated users to view and manage suppliers
    
  2. Security
    - For now, any authenticated user can manage suppliers (admin only)
    - In production, you may want to add a role-based system
